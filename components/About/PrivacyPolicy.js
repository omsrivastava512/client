            Our collection of Personal Information is necessary to comply with
            contractual obligations we have with the Internet Corporation for
            Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) and with certain TLD registries
            (“Registries”) so that you can validly register your domain name. In
            addition to Personal Information, our contracts with some Registries
            may require us to collect other personal information for the
            registration of a TLD such as certain professional affiliations,
            identification or other qualifiers (“Additional Personal
            Information”).

          <h2>
            <strong>Disclosure Of Information</strong>
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Public Whois.</strong>&nbsp;Our contracts with ICANN and
              other Registries require us to make certain domain name
              information (“WHOIS Information”) available and accessible to the
              public through a searchable port 43 “WHOIS” Service via a public
              webpage operated by the applicable registrar of record (“WHOIS
              Site”). The WHOIS Site is a publicly accessible database that
              lists WHOIS Information, including a particular domain name, the
              name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain
              name’s creation and expiration date. Except for EU/EEA natural
              persons (as described below), your Personal Information could be
              displayed on the WHOIS Site.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transfer Out.</strong>&nbsp;If you initiate a transfer out
              of a domain name away from us as the registrar of record, pursuant
              to our contract with ICANN, we may need to publish your registrant
              email address obtained from your Personal Information on the WHOIS
              Site for a period of approximately five (5) calendar days. After
              this period and assuming a valid transfer has occurred, you would
              cease to be our customer for that domain name and your WHOIS
              Information would be managed by the gaining registrar.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Certain Registries.</strong>&nbsp;Registries are third
              party providers of TLDs that are independent of domain registrars.
              If required by contract with a particular Registry, we may be
              obligated, as a domain registrar of domains provided by the
              Registry, to provide Personal Information and Additional Personal
              Information to such Registry to successfully complete your domain
              name registration. If we provide your Personal Information and
              Additional Personal Information to a Registry, the Registry has
              its own obligation to comply with applicable data privacy laws.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Escrow.</strong>&nbsp;Our contract with ICANN
              requires us to deposit the Personal Information collected with a
              secure third-party escrow provider who acts solely as a holder of
              the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Permitted Disclosures.</strong>&nbsp;We may also disclose
              your Personal Information when required by the rules, regulations,
              and policies of ICANN, including but not limited to the Uniform
              Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We store this data we collect in a variety of places within our
