        refer to us who signs up for hosting. All orders must be for the

      <br />
      <li>
        Referred customers must maintain an active hosting service during any
        free trial and/or money-­back guarantee periods applicable in order for
        the affiliate Reward to be considered earned. Affiliates will not

        receive a refund, or become suspended during these free trial and/or
        money-­back guarantee periods.

        information and any other personal information that will impact the
        ability to issue a valid payment. Each Affiliate is required to submit
        an accurate and up to date W­8/W­9 tax form. If we do not receive the
        necessary tax or payment information from you within ninety (30) days of
        a qualifying referral sale that would otherwise trigger a Reward, such
        Reward shall not accrue and no resulting Reward will be owed with

        Missing or untracked affiliate referrals must be reported within 14 days
        of the qualifying referred sale and will be credited to your account at
        our sole discretion, provided that such credit has accrued pursuant to
        all terms in the Affiliate Terms of Service. Referrals that are not
        reported during the then-­current referral period will not be credited
        to your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Earned Rewards are available for redemption after the 30­-day holding
        period, provided that the Affiliate has chosen to cash out their
        Rewards. For affiliates who have an earnings balance in excess of $20,
        earned Rewards will be paid out via PayPal on the first business day
        after the 10th of the month. Such Rewards payments are subject to a 5%
        Paypal processing fee.
